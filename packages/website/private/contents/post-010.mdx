Waku v0.23 is here with an exciting new level of control with the router! This includes two new features: Route Groups and Page Parts.

Route Groups are helpful for grouping a set of routes to share a layout. Very similar versions exist for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups) and [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/solid/routing/routing-concepts#pathless-route-group-directories).

Page Parts allow for mixing `static` and `dynamic` rendering on the same page.

## Route Groups

The path of a file inside the `pages` directory determines its route and the layouts it will have. One thing we knew we’d have to support is a way to group together layout combinations that allow for convenient composition independent of the route itself. This is where Route Groups come in.

Let’s say you’d like to have a home page at `/`, but all other routes should share a layout which is not used on `/`. This is now possible by grouping those routes in a directory marked with parenthesis (e.g., `(some-group)`). An example file setup:

```
├── (some-group)
│ ├── _layout.tsx
│ ├── about.tsx
│ └── other-page.tsx
└── index.tsx
```

The composition capabilities that Route Groups unlock are really cool too! You could have some work you’d like to only occur for the layout at build time (`static`), then have more work that should be done for all routes at runtime (`dynamic`). This example could be setup like:

```
(some-group)
├── (another-group)
│ ├── _layout.tsx # dynamic layout
│ ├── about.tsx
│ └── other-page.tsx
└── _layout.tsx # static layout
```

Layouts can essentially slot in anywhere and are great for components, state, or data shared across routes.

## Page Parts

Before Waku v0.23 a page was either all `static` or all `dynamic`. We’re now introducing the ability to compose pages like this:

```tsx
// just an example to show the full component tree of a page with parts
<Root>
  <Layout>
    <StaticPageComponent /> // ordering is flexible here
    <DynamicPageComponent />
    <AnotherStaticPageComponent />
  </Layout>
</Root>
```

Before we supported only a single page component (and that will stay the default). Page Parts add a level of control that we think can be really powerful. Now any combination of parts is possible. Above we see `static` followed by `dynamic` followed again by `static`, but we could do any pattern or sequence.

### How does it work?

The filename convention for Page Parts is `_part${string}.tsx` (TypeScript string literal syntax). So to replicate the example above for route `/foo` we would have the following files:

```
pages
├── _layout.tsx
├── foo
│ ├── _part-banana.tsx # these combine to be the children for /foo
│ ├── _part-orange.tsx
│ └── _part-cherry.tsx
└── bar.tsx # /foo/bar
```

Then your component definition could look like this:

```tsx
export default function Banana() {
  return <p>🍌</p>;
}

export const getConfig = () => {
  return {
    render: 'static',
    order: 0, // NEW!
  };
};
```

The `order` here determines the order in which Banana is rendered on the `/foo` page. So in this case orange could have `order: 1` to be rendered next, and cherry could have `order: 2` to be last. Now the full route is assembled from the three parts.

## There’s more to come

Waku Router is built to be minimal and powerful. We’re really excited to see what you can build with Fine-Grained Component Render Modes. We’d love to hear from you on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/MrQdmzd), [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/wakujs/waku/discussions), or [around](https://x.com/wakujs) [the](https://bsky.app/profile/daishikato.com) [web](https://fosstodon.org/@daishi).

P.S., We have a [few more things](https://github.com/wakujs/waku/issues/24) coming soon!
