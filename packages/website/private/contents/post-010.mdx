Waku v0.23 is here with an exciting new level of control with the router! This includes two new features: Route Groups and Page Part Components.

Route Groups are helpful for grouping a set of routes to share a layout. Very similar versions exist for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups) and [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/solid/routing/routing-concepts#pathless-route-group-directories).

Page Part Components will allow for making part of a page `static` and the other part `dynamic`. More on this later.

## Route Groups

With Waku Router, the path of a file inside `pages` determines it's route and the layouts it will have. Layouts are now common to different React frameworks. One thing we knew we'd need to support is a way to group together layout combinations that allow for convenient composition independent of the route itself. This is where Route Groups come in.

Let's say you'd like to have a home page at `/`, but all other routes should share a layout/context which is not used on `/`. This is now possible with `/(subroutes)/_layout.tsx`. An example file setup:

```
├── (subroutes)
│ ├── _layout.tsx
│ ├── about.tsx
│ └── other-page.tsx
└── index.tsx
```

The composition capabilities that Route Groups unlock are really cool too! You could have some work you'd like to only occur for the layout at build time (`static`), then have more work that should be done for all routes at runtime (`dynamic`). This example could be setup like:

```
(subroutes)/
├── (subroute-pages)
│ ├── _layout.tsx # dynamic layout
│ ├── about.tsx
│ └── other-page.tsx
└── _layout.tsx # static layout
```

Layouts can essentially slot in anywhere and give a great feel of shared layout and/or data across routes.

## Page Part Components

Before Waku v0.23 a page is either all `static` or all `dynamic`. We're now introducing the ability to compose pages like this:

```tsx
// just an example to show the full component tree of a "page"
<Root>
  <Layout>
    <StaticPageComponent /> // ordering is flexible here
    <DynamicPageComponent />
  </Layout>
</Root>
```

Before, we supported a single page component (and that will stay the default). Page part components add a level of control that we think can be really powerful. Any combination of parts is now trivially possible. Above we see `static, dynamic` but we could do `static, dynamic, static`, `dynamic, static, dynamic` and so on.

### How Does It Work?

The filename convention for page parts is `_part${string}.tsx` (typescript string literal syntax). So to replicate the example above for route `/foo` we would have the following files:

```
pages
├── _layout.tsx
├── foo
│ ├── _part-banana.tsx
│ └── _part-orange.tsx
└── index.tsx
```

Then your component definition could look like this:

```tsx
export default function Banana() {
  return <p>🍌</p>;
}

export const getConfig = () => {
  return {
    render: 'static',
    order: 0,
  };
};
```

The `order` here determines the order in which Banana is rendered. So in this case, orange could have `order: 1` to be rendered next.

## There's More To Come

Waku Router is built to be minimal and powerful. We're really excited to see what you can build with Fine-Grained Component Render Modes. We'd love to hear from you on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/MrQdmzd), [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/wakujs/waku/discussions), or [around](https://x.com/wakujs) [the](https://bsky.app/profile/daishikato.com) [web](https://fosstodon.org/@daishi).

PS: We have a [few more things](https://github.com/wakujs/waku/issues/24) coming soon!
